# tangram github repository
Software resources for two Safari presentations: 

(1) [Object Oriented GUI design in Java](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/live-training/courses/object-oriented-gui-design-in-java/0636920179009/) delivered on June 20 2018

(2) [Design Patterns in Java GUI Development](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/live-training/courses/design-patterns-in-java-gui-development/0636920179641/) delivered on June 22 2018

# Repository est omnis divisa in partes tres
This repository is divided into three parts

(1) **sample** contains code that introduces the Entity/Boundary/Controller design paradigm. There is [a series of videos](https://heineman.github.io/TangramProject/sample/) that shows how to construct this sample application step by step. There are seven milestones (**sample.0** to **sample.6**) 

(2) **src** contains the source code for the Tangram application project. The first course describes how to set up the application using EBC. The second course explains how design patterns can improve the extensibility and maintenance of the application

(3) **test** contains the JUnit (3.0) test cases for both projects. We chose to use JUnit 3.0 since it is the simplest of the available JUnit implementations

# How to access to code without using Git
There are nineteen releases (or milestones). There are seven for **sample** and twelve for **tangram**. These zip (and tar.gz files) can be downloaded and imported into any development environment, although they most directly can be imported by Eclipse. You could also simply store the Java classes and compile from the command line, if you prefer.

# Change Log
Should any changes be required for the provided source code, a list of significant (and perhaps not-so-significant) changes will appear here.
